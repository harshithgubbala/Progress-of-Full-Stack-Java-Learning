Patterns:
why patterns:
->> Patterns are solved to improve our skills in problem solving and also improves our efficiency in using loops.

How to solve them
->> Most of the patterns is solved using Nested for loops.
->> outer Loop is for the no of rows.
->> second is for the elements in the row.
->> Observe the symmetry.

points to be noted: 
->> using or calling a function/class is less efficient than manipulating the line and printing.
Example:
we have to print this pattern
1
11
111
1111 
instead of printing/calling System.out.println multiple times. we can use a string and append the 1 into the string and printing the line once in every loop.
